# Break down of the process into steps

### 1. Set up an S3 bucket: 
First, you need an S3 bucket where files will be uploaded. Let's call it "photo-processing-store".

### 2. Set up an SNS topic: 
Create an SNS topic to which notifications will be sent.

### 3. Create a Lambda function: 
This Lambda function will be triggered whenever a file is uploaded to the S3 bucket. The function will process the file and then publish a message to the SNS topic.

### 4. Subscribe to SNS topic: 
Subscribe an email or any other endpoint to the SNS topic to receive notifications.

### 5. Permissions: 
Ensure the Lambda function has permissions to access the S3 bucket and publish messages to the SNS topic.

### Test: 
Upload a file to the S3 bucket and verify that you receive a notification.
